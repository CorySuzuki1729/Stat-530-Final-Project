In this paper, we provide a detailed experimental investigation of the physical activity performance of hikers. The response variable of primary interest is the number of miles a hiker can hike within a sixty-minute time frame. The variable factors to be blocked will be temperature which is measured in degrees and humidity level which is measured in percent. For this experiment, since the temperature and humidity level are of little interest, these nuisance factors will be blocked using a Latin Square design of size $4$ with $3$ replications. From the analysis of the data, we conclude that temperatures 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 75 degrees Fahrenheit are statistically significant. For humidity levels in percentages, humidity levels $5\%$, $10\%$, $15\%$ are statistically significant.
